<h3>I Have Done a Lot of Things in my Life</h3>
<p class="story">Sometimes it amazes me when I think about it. And it would be strange if it amazed me when I did not think about it. I mean, generally, thinking is good, and being amazed is good - if you are amazed by the right things. Everyone is amazed at their own amaze-capacity. Someone could be amazed by how awesome the ocean is - an enormous vast reserve of raw energy! Amazing. </p>
<h4>On the other hand...</h4>
<p class="story">Someone could be amazed by a flower - the delicate structure of beauty and intricacy - if the wind blows the wrong way it may never fulfill its entire purpose of being! The are so many amazing, awesome, mind-consuming subjects with which one could fill his entire time in this world.</p>
<h4>I went canoeing with my daughter...</h4>
<p class="story">We went around a bend in the river and there were currents, bubbles, and turbulence in the water. The disruptive flow was usually only around the bends. Sometimes there was wind - that might explain the turbulence - and sometimes there was absolutely no wind. Sometimes you could feel the rocks close to the surface that would cause the water to jump and skitter - and sometimes there were no rocks. Sometimes there were no rocks, no wind, and no current, and still the water looked just as active as it did when there were rocks, wind and current. </p>
<p class="story">In other words, there was no way for us to gather enough information with our limited understanding to figure out why the water looked more active in some places than others! But for sure - there were causes of water turbulence other than wind, rocks and the obvious water current. </p>
<p class="story">My daughter wanted to say "fairies". I wasn't quite ready to go there. I was trying to teach her a little bit about scientific inquiry. I suggested that the first line of attack may be to ask people who you think may know more than you do. </p>
<p class="story">When we asked the people who rented us the canoe, they unequivocally answered us "Wind causes the turbulence". I asked, "What about those places where there is no wind?" "Impossible. You just can not feel it!" </p>
<p class="story">So now I am stuck with wind that pushes water around but I can not feel it! Sounds pretty mythological to me - but what do I know? I am just not sure how I am going to explain the difference between this mythological wind and fairies to my daughter... and besides - the fairies sounds like a better answer. I am just a little stuck!</p>
<h4>But I have been stuck before...</h4>
<p class="story">As a matter of fact - I have been stuck lots of times! I have been stuck for more time then some professional people have even been alive! My wife says "stuck" is my first name... </p>
<p class="story">Let me tell you about the time I dropped a swinging club (a wooden mallet) down four floors in a crowded department store in Koln, Germany. The club hit the enormous crystal chandelier on the way down, releasing many of the pieces that had been so delicately hung in concentric circles! People looking up were greeted by falling crystal and a swinging club!</p>
<p class="story">And when I found myself in a small room with a security officer trying to explain why I should not be juggling in the department store - well - I was stuck!</p>
<p class="story">Or what about the time the Italian police decided they wanted to drag me down to their police station in Firenze, Italy? When I figured out they were taking me to the station I was relieved - until I found myself in one room with the four guys who had picked me up... and I assure you, I was stuck!</p>
<p class="story">But I am not sure I have ever been more stuck then the time I was installing Apache on my Windows 7 machine - now that was stuck - so stuck, as a matter of fact, that it took me three days to extricate myself from the gunk.</p>
<p class="story">And that is the experience I am going to tell you about now.</p>
<h4>So, I want to build a website!</h4>
<p class="story">Great idea! I want to make a radical suggestion that you build your website on your own computer - so nobody else in the world can see it - and then you copy it someplace else so everybody in the world can see it. That way - you will be able to build it in private, and then publish it when it is quite ready. There is nothing more embarrassing then publishing a website with missing pages and links that do not work. </p>
<p class="story">Well, actually, there may be a few things more embarrassing - but for now let's just agree not to go there...</p>
<h4>How to install Apache WebServer for cgi Programming</h4>
<p class="story">A server is a program that serves its clients. Just as a bank teller is a person who serves clients one by one - a server also serves clients. </p>
<p class="story">When there are a bunch of different programs calling on the server for attention, the server keeps track of everyone and makes sure everyone gets what they came for. Just imagine what would happen if a bank teller fulfilled your money request to the guy next to you! </p>
<p class="story">And it would also be a problem if a server gave the services you asked for to fulfill the request that comes in right after you leave! </p>
<p class="story">And you ask, "What does a webserver serve?" A webserver serves web... pages! It's a big job, but someone has to do it! Your browser is essentially a big window to look at web pages in. When you enter a url (Uniform Resource Locator) in your browser address bar you are asking your browser to fetch a particular resource. One way of getting that resource is to go to a webserver. Your browser can usually figure this out properly.</p>
<p class="story">If it goes to the webserver, the webserver will figure out where the resource is and how to get it for the browser. Now it has to be clear, there is a lot going on here and I am just skimming over the top - kind of like believing the turbulence in the water is caused by wind...</p>
<p class="story">However, that being said, the webserver needs to know where the resource (for now, let's say file) actually exists. In other words, your server is going to have to keep track of lots of files and locations and stuff. Since the people writing this webserver don't want to you to have to recompile it and change the code (if you don't want to) they use a configuration file (and there are error logs also).</p>
<p class="story">First - download the apache web server from http://httpd.apache.org/ download.cgi. I downloaded a file called httpd-2.2.22-win32-x86-no_ssl - it was an .msi file. When you download something in windows, it naturally places it in your "download" folder. Since I don't know what I am doing, I let the computer do as much for me as possible - so that is where I am going to download the file to. The "download" folder.</p>
<p class="story">When I click on my downloaded file, it begins to install. At some point during the install, it offers to build the application in: C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2. I gratefully accept. And this is a good idea because when I decided I could do otherwise, I found that I could not. At least not very easily. </p>
<p class="story">When the install asks you for "Network Domain" and "Server Name" enter "localhost". The administrator's e-mail address can be "WebMaster@ localhost". This seems to be where you are telling Apache what to call itself on the computer. It is going to set itself up as "localhost". </p>
<p class="story">Finish installing - clicking through the boxes until they go away. Now you are ready to find out if anything happened! Go to the apache icon, and right click, then click "open apache monitor". If there is a green sun besides the name "Apache2.2", that is good. If not, try clicking "Start" and see what happens.</p>
<p class="story">If that all looks good, go to your browser and type "localhost" in the address bar. That should open up a page in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\index.html". If it opens up properly - so far so good! If not - check out the error log in C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\logs\error.log.</p>
<p class="story">What I usually do is look at the error log, then google the error message. I find that there is lots of conversation and many calls for help. That is the good thing about installing a webserver that, by itself, has over 61% of the marketshare (besides, it's free!)</p>
<p class="story">If that has worked so far, you are going to need to update the configuration file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2 \conf.conf. Remember the webserver has to keep track of lots of files and places - so the configuration file describes the root directories and makes everything relevant!</p>
<p class="story">The changes I made are as follows. First I made sure the line describing where my cgi files were going to go exists. The line is: </p>
<p class="story">ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/cgi-bin/"</p>
<p class="story">Presumably, this line tells apache how to map what it calls "cgi-bin" to the real computer. Right after that, I entered the line:</p>
<p class="story">AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl</p>
<p class="story">In order to tell the webserver that cgi and pl are real scripting files no matter where they come from.</p>
<p class="story">A few lines down, there is an entry for the directory... cgi-bin. One of the lines is "Options None" - I changed it to "Options +ExecCGI" (no quotes in the file).</p>
<h4>What about security and permissions</h4>
<p class="story">The way permissions works on Windows 7 is still a mystery to me! There are, in general, different functions that can be given with permission - i.e. read, write, execute, complete control. Then there are different people and groups who can be given information i.e. owner-admin, owner-user, various users, everybody. I gave everyone permission for everything possible.</p>
<p class="story">The way to give permission is by opening file explorer, right click on the highest level possible, click on "properties". Then click "Sharing", "Advanced Sharing" , Permissions, and then allow as much as possible.</p>
<h4>IDE for Perl</h4>
<p class="story">After I downloaded and installed apache, I decided I could use an Integrated Development Environment for Perl. I found Padre at http://padre. perlide.org/ - it's free, and works so far... The download and install are very straight-forward - and I like that!</p>
