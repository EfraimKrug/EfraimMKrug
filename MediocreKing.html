<h2>The King - He was alright...</h2>
<p class="story">There once was a king of a far away country. He was king - and he was alright. He was not a great king like some kings. He was not mindbogglingly wise like some kings. He was not fabulously wealthy like some kings. He was not overwhelmingly handsome like some kings. And he was not a great warrior - there was another one just next door who was  great warrior. </p>
<p class="story">Oh, the warrior next door was a gallant man! He would ride around the world in shiny armor! He rode a great steed with a lance, with a squire, and with an entire army! He could do away with armies and countries in a single day. He was an awe inspiring fighting warrior. When ladies were in trouble he would immediately ride to their aid and save them! When other warriors were in trouble, he would save them also. Sometimes he even saved dragons, demons and trolls. He was a truly remarkable man. Unlike our king - who although quite valiant, was nothing really special.</p>
<p class="story">And there was an incredibly handsome king on the other side - he was so handsome ladies would swoon when he walked out of his palace! The whole city was instantaneously filled with swooning ladies. Ladies would sometimes wonder why they were swooning, and then one would say to the other  that the king had just walked out. He was really handsome! Unlike our king - who although quite good looking, was nothing really special.</p>
<p class="story">And there was a fabulously wealthy king who lived wherever he wanted to, but usually resided in the kingdom equally close to the other three. He was so wealthy he would buy kingdoms for fun. In those days people traded in shares of neighboring kingdoms, and this king was often barred from buying or selling because he would throw the whole market out of kilter. So he never traded on the kingdom market, but he would go to other kings and buy their kingdoms out from under them. He was truly wealthy. Unlike our king - who although well to do, was not richer than other kings.</p>
<p class="story">And there was a mindbogglingly wise king who lived someplace else. Nobody really knew where he lived because he did not want to be bothered by all the questions he would be asked. When he would walk out into his kingdom, great scholars would wipe the sweat off their foreheads and squint their eyes to try to find a question worthy of his great wisdom. Often times these greatest of scholars would find him and ask him truly great questions, and he would answer in shock - very much flabbergasted - that these scholars would condescend to ask such a trivial question. He was truly wise. Unlike our king - who although bright enough, was not so much wiser than every other king.</p>
<p class="story">Our king was well known throughout the region as mediocre. He had average intellectual fire power. He had a bit more money than some kings, and a bit less than others - he was comfortable. He was fine to look at, but nobody ever swooned or gasped when he arrived to the party.  And he did not usually turn away from a good fight - but neither did he go to look for them. He was skilled enough - but no more.</p>
